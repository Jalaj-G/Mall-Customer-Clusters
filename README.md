# Mall-Customer-Clusters

This model was build to enable customer segmentation in a mall. Two algos were implemented and customers were divided into 5 clusters based on their annual income and spending scores.

Later, the performance of two models was compared using Silhouette score. The higher value of Silhouette score of 0.5539 is obtained in case of K-Means clustering.
